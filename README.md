## Featured Projects
___

* [Churn Prediction](https://github.com/judeonuh/Churn-Prediction.git): This project predicts Churn from an organisation's data. Churn rate is a measure of the number of customers or employees who leave a company during a given period. It can also refer to the amount of revenue lost as a result of the departures. Changes in a business's churn rate can provide valuable insight into an organization.  
This project will attempt to compare predictions from six models to find the best for the task.
* [Promotion Eligibility and Bias Analysis](https://github.com/judeonuh/Promotion-eligibility-and-bias-analysis.git): Employees of a company raised concerns that promotions are skewed and biased. This project uses machine learning to answer the business question: “Is the current promotion process biased? Which features should be used to make fair, explainable promotion eligibility decisions?”
* [Stroke Prediction Model](https://github.com/judeonuh/Stroke-Prediction-Model.git): This project compares 5 models and selects the best model to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.
* [Task Manager](https://github.com/judeonuh/finalCapstone.git): This program allows a user to manage their tasks. Program has been refactored from an initial simple task management system, incorporating new features.
